# Programming Examples
Examples of programming language implementations
## Prelude
I started this repository in my first semester at Karel De Grote Hogeschool, for students (and teachers) that had a background in other programming languages.

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to show new (and hopefully some experienced) programmers the basic syntax and implementation of each language this repo contains.

Currently, the repository includes snippets of the following programming languages:

## Collaboration
Feel free to make a pull request if you 
- See something out of order
- Want to add another programming language
